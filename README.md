This is a small repository for some [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) exercises.\
There are a few notebooks which include some basic machine learning algorithms and techniques, like **Linear Regression** and some **Activation Functions** to classify data.

Other ones contain some **Convolutional Neural Networks** in order to try to classify images of different objects and animals (accuracy is not that good, due to the simplicity architecture of the network, but it's a good start).
